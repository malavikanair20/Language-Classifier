# Language-Classifier
The language classifier identifies the language from the large chunk of sentences fed as the input similar to google's auto detect feature.The dataset consists of three languages i.e. Slovac, Czech and English. These datasets were first analyzed and then pre-processed. Further multinomial Naive-Bayes algorithm which is a machine learning algorithm that works on probablistic approach was used to classify the words. Certain imbalances were seen in the model which was evaluated using confusion matrix and further improved by using sophisticated techniques like using subwords.
